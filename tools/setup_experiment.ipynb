    "This notebook walks you through setting up a JSPsych experiment with WAVE backend integration. It will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Phase**: Guide you through installing dependencies and testing your experiment locally\n",
    "2. **Schema Definition**: Help you define the experiment data schema that matches your experiment's output\n",
    "3. **Backend Integration**: Create and test experiment types in the WAVE backend\n",
    "4. **Validation**: Run a complete test cycle to ensure data logging works correctly\n",
    "5. **Production Setup**: Create your final experiment for real data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites**: This notebook assumes you have already (mostly) set up your experiment code and WAVE client integration in `src/js/integrations/wave-client.js`. \n",
    "Also, copy `tools/.env.example` and rename it `tools/.env`, with API key information filled in\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Only share EXPERIMENTEE-level API keys with participants. Keep RESEARCHER-level keys secure and private."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Install uv Package Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "**SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU'VE ALREADY INSTALLED UV FOLLOWING THE README STEPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) - a fast Python package manager and project manager:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# On macOS/Linux:\n",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# On Windows:\n",

    "### 2. Install Project Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "**SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU'VE ALREADY INSTALLED UV FOLLOWING THE README STEPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root directory of this project, install the Python dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv sync\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install all dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml`, which specifies the packages needed for experiment setup, data validation, and WAVE backend integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Understanding UV Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "UV automatically creates and manages a virtual environment in the `.venv` folder. This keeps your project dependencies isolated from your system Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: If you encounter any package conflicts or want a completely clean slate, simply delete the `.venv` folder and `uv.lock` file and run `uv sync` again to recreate it from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Running This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "You have multiple options for running this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option A: VS Code Jupyter Extension**\n",
    "1. Install the [Jupyter VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)\n",
    "2. Open this notebook file in VS Code\n",
    "3. When prompted to select a kernel, choose the Python interpreter from the `.venv` folder:\n",
    "   - Click \"Select Kernel\" in the top-right of the notebook\n",
    "   - Choose \"Python Environments...\"\n",
    "   - Select the interpreter at `.venv/bin/python` (or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows)\n",
    "4. VS Code will use this virtual environment for all notebook cells\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option B: Jupyter Lab/Notebook**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "uv tool run jupyter lab\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will install dependencies and launch a Jupyter Lab instance in your browser. Navigate to `setup_experiment.ipynb` in the Jupyter file explorer and run this notebook from there\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option C: PyCharm IDE**\n",
    "1. Make sure your uv dependencies were installed following the instructions [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/uv.html)\n",
    "2. Open `setup_experiment.ipynb` in your IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Verify Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Run all of the input cells below, if they don't import the modules correctly, then something went wrong. Try the install procedures again"

    "### To clean up test experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add ADMIN_API_KEY to tools/.env**\n",

    "   - Add it to your `tools/.env` file:\n",
